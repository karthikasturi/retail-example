# Prompt: Hierarchical Use Case Structure for Retail Example

Create a hierarchical structure for the following ecommerce retail use cases, where each use case becomes an Epic. For each Epic, break it down into one or more User Stories. Each Story should be further divided into one or more Subtasks.

For every Epic, Story, and Subtask, provide:
- A clear, concise description.
- Acceptance criteria (bullet points).

For every Story and Subtask, also include a list of unit test cases (test case names and brief descriptions only, no code or implementation).

Use the following use cases as Epics:
1. User Registration & Login
2. Product Browsing
3. Add to Cart
4. Checkout & Order Placement
5. Order History
6. Admin: Product Management

Format your output as follows:

```
Epic: [Epic Title]
Description: [Epic description]
Acceptance Criteria:
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
...

  Story: [Story Title]
  Description: [Story description]
  Acceptance Criteria:
  - [Criterion 1]
  - [Criterion 2]
  ...
  Unit Test Cases:
  - [Test case name]: [Test case description]
  ...

    Subtask: [Subtask Title]
    Description: [Subtask description]
    Acceptance Criteria:
    - [Criterion 1]
    - [Criterion 2]
    ...
    Unit Test Cases:
    - [Test case name]: [Test case description]
    ...
```

Repeat this structure for each use case Epic.
